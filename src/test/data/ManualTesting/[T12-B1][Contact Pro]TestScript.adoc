** Add an appointment that is a bit more than 1 hour than the current time. For example, if current time is
17/11/2017 14:30, then add an appointment that starts around 17/11/2017 15:32: +
`appoint 1 ap/17/11/2017 15:32`
** Close the app.
** Start a new session.
** Appointment reminder will have a notifying message 60 minutes before the appointment starts, at around 14:32.
